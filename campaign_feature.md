System should have possibility to create, manage, implement different marketing campaigns. Campaigns could have wide
use cases, such as fund bonus or skip onboarding step for campaigns participants, send advertisement to each Yapital
user (consumer, business), etc.

#What it should do?
+ Somehow define Consumer as Campaign participant.

+ Define Campaign properties: budget, how long should it lasts, conditions to automatically stop it.

+ Campaign should have flexible management: different actions should be triggered by different events.

+ Campaign properties could be changed manually whenever it needed.

+ Campaign could be stopped or run again when it needed.

+ Should be possible to collect Campaign statistics: how many participants it have, how long it was,what events happened, what actions was performed.
