#Marketing campaigns
System should have possibility to create, manage, implement different marketing campaigns. Campaigns could have wide
use cases, such as fund bonus or skip onboarding step for campaigns participants, send advertisement to each Yapital
user, etc.

------------

#What it should do?
1. Somehow define Consumer as Campaign participant.
2. Define Campaign properties: budget, how long should it lasts, conditions to automatically stop it.
3. Campaign should have flexible management: different actions should be triggered by different events.
4. Campaign properties could be changed manually whenever it needed.
5. Camapign could be stopped or runned again when it needed.
6. Should be possible to collect Campaign statistics: how many participantans, when campaign stops if automatically,
what events happened, what actions was performed.

#Subfeatures
1. Campaign management. Create, edit properties, start, stop Campaigns. (link)
2. Campaign statistics. Collect and show Campaign statistics. (link)
3. User registration in Campaing. (link)
4. Campaign engine. Triggers action on event. (link)

#1. Campaign management
Most probably will be done as a part of WAT.
##Security risks
As Campaigns will closely work with consumers, it should be close attention on sensetive data.
No PCI-DSS risks expected.
##Performance risks
As Campaign management, probably, will be placed in WAT there is no need to have any performance ations at this stage.
